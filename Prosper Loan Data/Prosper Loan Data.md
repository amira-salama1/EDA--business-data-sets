## Dataset

>This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

> Borrower Annual Percentage Rate seem to have a normal distibution between the values above 0.01 and hair above 0.3 then an interesting high peak between 0.32 and 0.37 %, next I'll check loan status as the next variable.

>The 3 most frequent loan status values are the current (Top Value) then comes the completed status and charged off then the defaulted status loan.

>Most borrowers have an income range between 25K and 75K USD

>Prosper Score ranges from 1-10, with 10 being the best, or lowest risk score. Applicable for loans originated after July 2009. so the highest values are between 4 and 8 which is the average score of a prosper borrower.

>The distribution of the Loan Original Amount is right skewed where the highest values are between >1K and 15K, then a sudden drop above 15K with very little values on the right.

>Employed borrowers and full time employed have the highest count values among all the borrowers less loans to the not-employed and retired people.

>Regardless of the occupation of the borrower, a borrower doesn't have to hold a specific occupation to get the loan,There's not much difference if the borrower is a home owner or not.

>Most loans have average Credit score (C, D, B) respectively

>Most loans are 36 months Long in term, then 60 months and least value for shortest loan length of 12 months

>Most Monthly Loan Payment are between 200 to 500 USD, the distribution is right skewed with a high peak around 300 USD.

>The Credit Score Range seem to be normally distributed around 500 to 880 score, the higher the score the more liable for a borrower to get the loan, above 70% of the scores are higher than 580 score which is the fair score or the accepted one.

>The higher the income range the less the rate applied on the loan, on the opposite side not employed category has the highest loan rate
The highest income >75K has the highest loan amount on the opposite hand income < 25K has the Lowest loan amount

>The AA score of credit grade (which is the highest score) has the least borrower rate on average, on the opposite hand the HR and E credit scores have the highest borrower rate

>The highest loan amount is 60 months long, while the lowest loan amount are paid through 12 months term

>Borrower APR is inversly proportional with the Loan Original Amount, the higher the loan value the less the rate applied.

>Most of the current loans are between 1K and 15K

>The higher the prosper score the higher the range of the loan amount.

>Higher Credit score Ranges are associated with higher loan amounts and less loan rate applied.
High direct correlation between Loan Original Amount and Monthly Loan Payment, then a fair correlation between Term and Loan Original Amount,

>Negative relation between Loan Original Amount and Borrower's APR, also not surprisingly a high -ve relation between Credit Score Range and Borrower's APR, the higher the score the less the loan rate, the estimated return is highly correlated with the Borrower's APR.

>The highest charged off loans are among the poor ratings and its associated with higher BorrowerAPR, Also the highest Loan Original Amount are given to the higher prosper score with less probability of defaulting.

>The chargedoff loans are among the higher income ranges (more than 100K USD) category, so a higher income is also associated with a relative high risk of defaulting.

>The highest charged off loans were among the AA credit score (which is the best credit score), Highest incomes have the highest Credit scores, Not employed category have the lowest Credit scores
