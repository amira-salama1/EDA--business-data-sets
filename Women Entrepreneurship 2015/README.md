__Context__
The data were obtained from the Women Entrepreneurship Index and Global Entrepreneurship Index report published in 2015.
The research is limited to OECD countries where all data for 2015 are available at the same time in the database.


__Task Details__:
The aim of the study is to examine whether the 2015 Women's Entrepreneurship Index and Global Entrepreneurship Index show a significant difference between OECD countries that are members of the European Union and not, as well as to determine the significance of the relationship between the indexes.

Are European Union membership variable and development variable independent from each other? (Method Chi-Square Test and Crosstab)

Do the Women Entrepreneurship Index and Global Entrepreneurship Index values show a statistically significant difference between the countries that are members of the European Union and not? (Method Mann-Whitney U)

Is there a statistically significant relationship between Women's Entrepreneurship Index and Global Entrepreneurship Index values? (Method Spearman Correlation Coefficient)

There's an Excellent report from [The Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute ](https://thegedi.org/research/womens-entrepreneurship-index/) about the dataset although this research included more countries than that of the One on Kaggle.
